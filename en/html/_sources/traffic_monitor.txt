Traffic Monitor
===============

This section describes how to add a function to monitor OpenFlow switch statistical information to the switching hub explained in " :ref:`ch_switching_hub` ".


Routine Examination of Network
------------------------------

Networks have already become the infrastructure of many services and businesses, so maintaining of normal and stable operation is expected. Having said that, problems always occur.

When an error occurred on network, the cause must be identified and operation restored quickly. Needless to say, in order to detect errors and identify causes, it is necessary to understand the network status on a regular basis. For example, assuming the traffic volume of a port of some network device indicates a very high value, whether it is an abnormal state or is usually that way and when it became that way cannot be determined if the port's traffic volume has not been measured continuously.

For this reason, constant monitoring of the health of a network is essential for continuous and safe operation of the services or businesses that use that network.
As a matter of course, simply monitoring traffic information does not provide a perfect guarantee but this section describes how to use OpenFlow to acquire statistical information for a switch.


Implementation of Traffic Monitor
---------------------------------

The following is source code in which a traffic monitoring function has been added to the switching hub explained in " :ref:`ch_switching_hub` ".

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_monitor_13.py
    :lines: 16-

The traffic monitor function has been implemented in the SimpleMonitor13 class which inherited SimpleSwitch13, therefore, there is no packet transfer-related processing here.


Fixed-Cycle Processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In parallel with switching hub processing, create a thread to periodically issue a request to the OpenFlow switch to acquire statistical information.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_monitor_13.py
    :pyobject: SimpleMonitor13
    :end-before: set_ev_cls
    :append: # ...

There are some eventlet wrappers and basic class implementation in ``ryu.lib.hub``. Here, we use ``hub.spawn()``, which creates threads.
The thread actually created is an eventlet green thread.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_monitor_13.py
    :dedent: 4
    :prepend: # ...
    :pyobject: SimpleMonitor13
    :start-after: self.monitor_thread = hub.spawn(self._monitor)
    :end-before: def _request_stats(self, datapath):
    :append: # ...

In thread function ``_monitor()``, issuance of a statistical information acquisition request for the registered switch is repeated infinitely every 10 seconds.

In order to make sure the connected switch is monitored, ``EventOFPStateChange`` event is used for detecting connection and disconnection. This event is issued by the Ryu framework and is issued when the Datapath state is changed.

Here, when the Datapath state becomes ``MAIN_DISPATCHER``, that switch is registered as the monitor target and when it becomes ``DEAD_DISPATCHER``, the registration is deleted.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_monitor_13.py
    :dedent: 4
    :pyobject: SimpleMonitor13._request_stats

With periodically called ``_request_stats()``, ``OFPFlowStatsRequest`` and ``OFPPortStatsRequest`` are issued to the switch.

``OFPFlowStatsRequest`` requests that the switch provide statistical information related to flow entry.
The requested target flow entry can be narrowed down by conditions such as table ID, output port, cookie value and match but here all entries are made subject to the request.

``OFPPortStatsRequest`` request that the switch provide port-related statistical information.
It is possible to specify the desired port number to acquire information from. Here, ``OFPP_ANY`` is specified to request information from all ports.


FlowStats
^^^^^^^^^
In order to receive a response from the switch, create an event handler that receives the FlowStatsReply message.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_monitor_13.py
    :dedent: 4
    :prepend: @set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPFlowStatsReply, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
    :pyobject: SimpleMonitor13._flow_stats_reply_handler

``OPFFlowStatsReply`` class's attribute ``body`` is the list of ``OFPFlowStats`` and stores the statistical information of each flow entry, which was subject to FlowStatsRequest.

All flow entries are selected except the Table-miss flow of priority 0. The number of packets and bytes matched to the respective flow entry are output by being sorted by the received port and destination MAC address.

Here, only part of values are output to the log but in order to continuously collect and analyze information, linkage with external programs may be required. In such a case, the content of ``OFPFlowStatsReply`` can be converted to the JSON format.

For example, it can be written as follows:

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

::

    import json

    # ...

    self.logger.info('%s', json.dumps(ev.msg.to_jsondict(), ensure_ascii=True,
                                      indent=3, sort_keys=True))

In this case, the output is as follows:

.. rst-class:: console

::

    {
       "OFPFlowStatsReply": {
          "body": [
             {

          ], 
          "flags": 0, 
          "type": 1
       }
    }


PortStats
^^^^^^^^^

In order to receive a response from the switch, create an event handler that receives the PortStatsReply message.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_monitor_13.py
    :dedent: 4
    :prepend: @set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPPortStatsReply, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
    :pyobject: SimpleMonitor13._port_stats_reply_handler

``OPFPortStatsReply`` class's attribute ``body`` is the list of ``OFPPortStats``.

``OFPPortStats`` stores statistical information such as port numbers, send/receive packet count, respectively, byte count, drop count, error count, frame error count, overrun count, CRC error count, and collision count.

Here, being sorted by port number, receive packet count, receive byte count, receive error count, send packet count, send byte count, and send error count are output.


Executing Traffic Monitor
-------------------------

Now, let's actually execute this traffic monitor.

First of all, as with " :ref:`ch_switching_hub` ", execute Mininet. Do not forget to set OpenFlow13 for the OpenFlow version.

Next, finally, let's execute the traffic monitor.

controller: c0:

.. rst-class:: console

In " :ref:`ch_switching_hub` ", the SimpleSwitch13 module name (ryu.app.example_switch_13) was specified for the ryu-manager command. However, the SimpleMonitor13 module name (ryu.app.simple_monitor_13) is specified here.

At this point, there is no flow entry (Table-miss flow entry is not displayed) and the count of each port is all 0.

Let's execute ping from host 1 to host 2.

host: h1:

.. rst-class:: console

::

    # ping -c1 10.0.0.2
    PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 94.489/94.489/94.489/0.000 ms
    # 

Packet transfer and flow entry are registered and statistical information is changed.

controller: c0:

    0000000000000001        2        3      182        0        3      182        0

According to the flow entry statistical information, traffic matched to the receive port 1's flow is recorded as 1 packet, 42 bytes. With receive port 2, it is 2 packets, 140 bytes.

According to the port statistical information, the receive packet count (rx-pkts) of port 1 is 3, the receive byte count (rx-bytes) is 182 bytes. With port 2, it is 3 packets and 182 bytes, respectively.

Figures do not match between the statistical information of flow entry and that of port. The reason for that is because the flow entry statistical information is the information of packets that match the entry and were transferred. That means, packets for which Packet-In is issued by Table-miss and are transferred by Packet-Out are not included in these statistics.

In this case, three packets that is the ARP request first broadcast by host 1, the ARP reply returned by host 2 to host 1, and the echo request issued by host 1 to host 2, are transferred by Packet-Out.
For the above reason, the amount of port statistics is larger than that of flow entry.
