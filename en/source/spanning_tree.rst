Spanning Tree
=============

This section describes how to implement spanning tree using Ryu.


Spanning tree
-------------

Spanning tree is a function that suppresses occurrence of broadcast streams in a network having a loop structure. Also, applying the original function that is preventing the loop, it is used as a means to secure network redundancy to automatically switch the path in case of a network failure.

There are various types of spanning tree, including STP, RSTP, PVST+, and MSTP. In this section, we will take a look at implementation of the most basic STP.


Spanning Tree Protocol (STP: IEEE 802.1D) handles a network as a logical tree and by setting the ports of each switch (sometimes called a bridge in this section) to transfer frame or not it suppresses occurrence of broadcast streams in a network having a loop structure.

With STP, Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) packets are exchanged between bridges to compare the bridge and port information and decide whether or not frame transfer of each port is available.

Specifically, this is achieved by the following procedure:

1 Selecting the root bridge

    The bridge having the smallest bridge ID is selected as the root bridge through BPDU packet exchange between bridges. After that, only the root bridge sends the original BPDU packet and other bridges transfer BPDU packets received from the root bridge.

.. NOTE::

    The bridge ID is calculated through a combination of the bridge priority set for each bridge and the MAC address of the specific port.

        Bridge ID

        ================ ==============
        Upper 2byte      Lower 6byte
        ================ ==============
        Bridge priority  MAC address
        ================ ==============

2 Deciding the role of ports

    Based on the cost of each port to reach the root bridge, decide the role of the ports.

    * Root port

        The port having the smallest cost among bridges to reach the root bridge.
        This port receives BPDU packets from the root bridge.

    * Designated ports

        Ports at the side having the small cost to reach the root bridge of each link.
        These ports sends BPDU packets received from the root bridge.
        Root bridge ports are all designated ports.

    * Non designated ports

        Ports other than the root port and designated port.
        These ports suppress frame transfer.

        :align: center
        :scale: 50 %



.. NOTE::

    The cost to reach the root bridge is compared as follows based on the setting value of the BPDU packet received by each port.

        Priority 1: Compares by the root path cost value.

            When each bridge transfers a BPDU packet, the path cost value set for the output port is added to the root path cost value of the BPDU packet. Because of this, the root path cost value is the total value of the path cost value of each link passed through to reach the root bridge. 

        Priority 2: When the root path cost is the same, compares using the bridge ID of the counterpart bridges.

        Priority 3: When the bridge ID of the counterpart bridges are the same (in cases in which each port is connected to the same bridge), compare using the port ID of the counterpart ports.

            Port ID

            ============== ================
            Upper 2 bytes  Lower 2 bytes
            ============== ================
            Port priority  Port number
            ============== ================


3 Port state change

    After the port role is decided (STP calculation is completed), each port becomes LISTEN state. After that, the state changes as shown below and according to the role of each port, it eventually becomes FORWARD state or BLOCK state. Ports set as disabled ports in the configuration become DISABLE state and after that the change of state does not take place.

   .. image:: images/spanning_tree/fig3.eps

.. only:: not latex and not epub

    .. image:: images/spanning_tree/fig3.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 50 %


    Each port decides operations such as frame transfer availability according to the state.

    ======== =============================================
    State    Operation
    ======== =============================================
    DISABLE  Disabled port. Ignores all received packets.
    BLOCK    Receives BPDU only.
    LISTEN   Sends and receives BPDU.
    LEARN    Sends and receives BPDU, learns MAC.
    FORWARD  Sends and receives BPDU, learns MAC, transfers frames.
    ======== =============================================



When that processing is executed at each bridge, ports that transfer frames and ports that suppress frame transfer are decided to dissolve loops inside the network.

Also, when failure is detected due to link down or no reception of BPDU packet for the max age (default: 20 seconds), or a change in the network topology is detected as a result of the addition of a port, each bridge executes 1, 2, and 3 above to reconfigure the tree (STP re-calculation).



Executing the Ryu Application
-----------------------------

Let's execute the Ryu's spanning tree application for which the spanning function is achieved using OpenFlow.

This program is an application to which the spanning tree function has been added to the switching hub of " :ref:`ch_switching_hub` .


Source name: ``simple_switch_stp_13.py``

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_switch_stp_13.py
    :lines: 16-

.. NOTE::

    If using the Open vSwitch, this application does not wrok well depending
    on the Open vSwitch's settings or version.
    Open vSwitch has the STP implementation, but if this option is disabled
    (by default), Open vSwitch drops the STP (BPDU) packets with the dest mac
    address "01:80:c2:00:00:00" specified in IEEE 802.1D.
    For only executing this application, you can avoid this constraint by
    modifying the source code as follows.

    ryu/ryu/lib/packet/bpdu.py:

    .. rst-class:: sourcecode

    ::

        # BPDU destination
        #BRIDGE_GROUP_ADDRESS = '01:80:c2:00:00:00'
        BRIDGE_GROUP_ADDRESS = '01:80:c2:00:00:0e'

    Then, execute the following commands to affect the modification.

    .. rst-class:: console

    ::

        $ cd ryu
        $ sudo python setup.py install
        running install
        ...
        ...
        running install_scripts
        Installing ryu-manager script to /usr/local/bin
        Installing ryu script to /usr/local/bin


Configuring the Experimental Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's configure an experimental environment to confirm operation of the spanning tree application.

For details on environment configuration and the login method, etc. to use VM images, refer to " :ref:`ch_switching_hub` ".

To operate using a special topology having a loop structure, as with " :ref:`ch_link_aggregation` ", using the topology configuration script, configure a mininet environment.


Source name: ``spanning_tree.py``

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../sources/spanning_tree.py


By executing the program in the VM environment, a topology is created in which a loop exists between switches s1, s2, and s3.

    h3 h3-eth0:s3-eth1


Setting the OpenFlow Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set the OpenFlow version to 1.3.
Input this command on xterm of switches s1, s2, and x3.


Node: s1:

.. rst-class:: console

::

    # ovs-vsctl set Bridge s1 protocols=OpenFlow13


Node: s2:

.. rst-class:: console

::

    # ovs-vsctl set Bridge s2 protocols=OpenFlow13


Node: s3:

.. rst-class:: console

::

    # ovs-vsctl set Bridge s3 protocols=OpenFlow13




Executing the Switching Hub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This completes preparation so let's move on to executing the Ryu application. Execute the following commands from xterm for which the window title is "Node: c0 (root)".


Node: c0:

.. rst-class:: console

::

    $ ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_stp_13
    loading app ryu.app.simple_switch_stp_13
    loading app ryu.controller.ofp_handler
    instantiating app None of Stp
    creating context stplib
    instantiating app ryu.app.simple_switch_stp_13 of SimpleSwitch13
    instantiating app ryu.controller.ofp_handler of OFPHandler


Calculating STP Upon OpenFlow Swtich Starts
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When connection between each OpenFlow switch and the controller is completed, exchange of BPDU packets starts and root bridge selection, port role setting, and port state change takes place.

As a result, each port eventually becomes FORWARD state or BLOCK state.

Next, in order to confirm that packets are not looped, execute ping from host 1 to host 2.

Before executing the ping command, execute the tcpdump command.



Node: s1:

.. rst-class:: console

::

    # tcpdump -i s1-eth2 arp


Node: s2:

.. rst-class:: console

::

    # tcpdump -i s2-eth2 arp


Node: s3:

.. rst-class:: console

::

    # tcpdump -i s3-eth2 arp


On the console where the topology configuration script is executed, execute the following commands to issue a ping from host 1 to host 2.


.. rst-class:: console

::

    mininet> h1 ping h2

    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.041/7.784/84.407/24.230 ms


As a result of tcpdump output, you can confirm that ARP is not looped.

Spanning Tree by OpenFlow
-------------------------

In Ryu's spanning tree application, let's look at how spanning tree is implemented using OpenFlow.

OpenFlow 1.3 provides config to configure the following port operation.
By issuing a Port Modification message to the OpenFlow switch, it is possible to control operations such as availability of port frame transfer.

=================== ============================================================
Value               Explanation
=================== ============================================================
OFPPC_PORT_DOWN     Status in which maintenance personnel has set it to disable.
OFPPC_NO_RECV       Discards all packets received by the port.
OFPPC_NO_FWD        Packets are not transferred from the port.
OFPPC_NO_PACKET_IN  In case of table-miss, Packet-In messages are not sent.
=================== ============================================================


Also, in order to control BPDU packet reception and reception of packets other than BPDU for each port, flow entry that sends Packet-In of BPDU packets and flow entry that drops packets other than BPDU are registered in the OpenFlow switch using Flow Mod messages, respectively.


The controller controls sending/receiving of BPDU packets depending on the port status, learning of MAC addresses (receiving packets other than BPDU), and frame transfer (sending packets other then BPDU) by setting the port configuration and flow entry on the OpenFlow switch as shown below.


======= ================== ============================================
Status  Port configuration Flow entry
======= ================== ============================================
DISABLE NO_RECV/NO_FWD     No setting
BLOCK   NO_FWD             BPDU Packet-In, drop packets other than BPDU
LISTEN  No setting         BPDU Packet-In, drop packets other than BPDU
LEARN   No setting         BPDU Packet-In, drop packets other than BPDU
FORWARD No setting         BPDU Packet-In
======= ================== ============================================


.. NOTE::

    For simplification, the spanning tree library implemented by Ryu does not perform MAC address learning (receiving packets other than BPDU) in Learn status.


In addition to those settings, by building the BPDU packet for transmission based on the port information collected when connecting to an Open Flow switch and the root bridge information set in the BPDU packet received by each OpenFlow switch and issuing a Packet-Out message, the controller achieves BPDU packet exchange between OpenFlow switches.


Using Ryu to Implement Spanning Tree
------------------------------------

Next, let's take a look at the source code of spanning tree implemented using Ryu.
The spanning tree source code is in the Ryu's source tree.

    ryu/lib/stplib.py

    ryu/app/simple_switch_stp_13.py


stplib.py is a library that provides spanning tree functions such as BPDU packet exchange and management of rules, and the status of each port.
The simple_switch_stp_13.py is an application program in which the spanning tree function is added to the switching hub application using the spanning tree library.


Implementing the Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the STP library (Stp class instance) detects connection of an OpenFlow switch to the controller, a Bridge class instance and Port class instance are generated. After each class instance is generated and started,

* Notification of the OpenFlow message reception from the Stp class instance
* STP calculation of the Bridge class instance (loot bridge selection and selection of the role of each port)
* Status change of the port of the Port class instance and send/receive of BPDU packets

work together to achieve the spanning tree function.



Configuration Settings Item
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The STP library provides the bridge port config setting IF using the ``Stp.set_config()`` method. The following items can be set:


* bridge

     ``enable``     Port enable/disable setting  True
    =============== ============================ ============================



Sending BPDU Packet
"""""""""""""""""""

BPDU packets are sent by the BPDU packet send thread (``Port.send_bpdu_thread``) of the Port class. When the port role is the designated port (``DESIGNATED_PORT``), a BPDU packet is generated (``Port._generate_config_bpdu()``) at the hello time (``Port.port_times.hello_time``: by default, 2 seconds) notified by the root bridge and the BPDU packet is sent (``Port.ofctl.send_packet_out()``).

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/lib/stplib.py
    :prepend: class Port(object):
              # ...
    :pyobject: Port.__init__

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/lib/stplib.py
    :prepend: class Port(object):
              # ...
    :pyobject: Port._transmit_bpdu

BPDU packets to be sent are configured based on the port information (``Port.ofport``) collected when the controller is connected to OpenFlow switches or the root bridge information (``Port.port_priority, Port.port_times``) set in the received BPDU packets.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/lib/stplib.py
    :prepend: class Port(object):
              # ...
    :pyobject: Port._generate_config_bpdu

Receiving BPDU Packets
""""""""""""""""""""""

Reception of a BPDU packet is detected by the Packet-In event handler of the Stp class and is notified to the Port class instance via the Bridge class instance.
For implementation of the event handler, refer to ":ref:`ch_switching_hub`".

The port that receives a BPDU packet compares (``Stp.compare_bpdu_info()``) the bridge ID of previously received BPDU packets and the BPDU packet received this time to determine the need for STP re-calculation. If a superior BPDU (``SUPERIOR``) than the previously received BPDU is received, it means there is a change in the network topology such as "a new root bridge is added", which is a a trigger for STP re-calculation.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/lib/stplib.py
    :prepend: class Port(object):
              # ...
    :pyobject: Port.rcv_config_bpdu

Detecting Failures
""""""""""""""""""

When direct failure such as link down or indirect failure such as no reception of BPDU packet from the root bridge for the predetermined period of time is detected, it is a trigger for STP re-calculation.

Link down is detected by the PortStatus event handler of the Stp class and is notified to the Bridge class instance.

Timeout of BPDU packet receive waiting is detected by the BPDU packet receive waiting thread (``Port.wait_bpdu_thread``) of the Port class. When BPDU packets from the root bridge cannot be received for the maximum age (default: 20 seconds), an indirect failure is determined and is notified to the Bridge class instance.

For update of the BPDU receive waiting timer and detection of timeout, ``hub.Event`` and ``hub.Timeout`` of the hub module (ryu.lib.hub) are used. ``hub.Event`` enters wait status by ``hub.Event.wait()`` and the thread is suspended until ``hub.Event.set()`` is executed. ``hub.Timeout`` issues an ``hub.Timeout`` exception if processing of the ``try`` clause is not completed within the specified timeout time.
When ``hub.Event`` enters wait status and ``hub.Event.set()`` is not executed within the timeout time specified in ``hub.Timeout``, timeout of BPDU packet receive waiting is determined and STP re-calculation processing of the Bridge class is called.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/lib/stplib.py
    :prepend: class Port(object):
              # ...
    :pyobject: Port._wait_bpdu_timer

When ``SUPERIOR`` or ``REPEATED`` is determined as a result of comparison processing (``Stp.compare_bpdu_info()``) of the received BPDU packet, it means that the BPDU packet from the root bridge can be received. Therefore, the BPDU receive waiting timer is updated (``Port._update_wait_bpdu_timer()``). By the ``set()`` processing of ``Port.wait_timer_event``, which is a ``hub.Event``, the ``Port.wait_timer_event`` is released from wait status and the BPDU packet receive waiting thread (``Port.wait_bpdu_thread``) cancels the timer without entering timeout processing of the ``except hub.Timeout`` clause and sets the timer again to start waiting for the next BPDU packet to be received.

STP Calculation
"""""""""""""""

STP calculation (selection of the root bridge and selection of the role of each port) is executed by the Bridge class.

In cases where STP calculation is executed, a change in the network topology has occurred and it is possible for packets to be looped. Therefore, by setting all ports to BLOCK state (``port.down``) and also notifying the topology change event (``EventTopologyChange``) to high order APL, initialization of already learned MAC address information is promoted.

After that, the root bridge and the role of ports are selected by ``Bridge._spanning_tree_algorithm()``, and each port is started in LISTEN status (``port.up``) to start port status change.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/lib/stplib.py
    :prepend: class Bridge(object):
              # ...
    :pyobject: Bridge.recalculate_spanning_tree

To select the root bridge, own bridge information such as bridge ID, etc. is compared with other bridge's information set in the BPDU packet received by each port (``Bridge._select_root_port``).

As a result, when the root port is found (the other bridge's information received by the port is superior to that of the own bridge), the other bridge is determined to be the root bridge and the designated ports (``Bridge._select_designated_port``) and non-designated ports are selected (ports other than the root port/designated ports are selected as non-designated ports).

On the other hand, if the root port is not found (own bridge information is the most superior), the own bridge is determined to be the root bridge and all other ports are designated ports.

    :prepend: class Bridge(object):
              # ...
    :pyobject: Bridge._spanning_tree_algorithm

Port Status Change
""""""""""""""""""

Status change processing of ports is executed by the status change control thread (``Port.state_machine``) of the Port class. It uses ``Port._get_timer()`` to get the timer to change to the next status and after the timer elapses, uses ``Port._get_next_state()`` to get the next status to change the status. Also, the status is changed when ``Port._change_status()`` is executed in case that when STP re-calculation occurs and the status is changed to BLOCK status, regardless of the previous port status. This processing is achieved using ``hub.Event`` and ``hub.Timeout`` of the hub module, as with "`Detecting Failures`_".

Implementing the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section explains the difference between the spanning tree application (simple_switch_stp_13.py), which supports OpenFlow 1.3 described in "`Executing the Ryu Application`_" and the switching hub of " :ref:`ch_switching_hub`", in order.


Setting "_CONTEXTS"
"""""""""""""""""""

As with " :ref:`ch_link_aggregation` ", register CONTEXT to use the STP library.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_switch_stp_13.py
    :prepend: from ryu.lib import stplib
              # ...
    :pyobject: SimpleSwitch13
    :end-before: __init__

Setting Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""""

Use the ``set_config()`` method of the STP library to set configuration.
Here, the following values are set as a sample.

===================== =============== =======
OpenFlow switch       Item            Setting
===================== =============== =======
dpid=0000000000000001 bridge.priority 0x8000
dpid=0000000000000002 bridge.priority 0x9000
dpid=0000000000000003 bridge.priority 0xa000
===================== =============== =======

Using these settings, the bridge ID of the dpid=0000000000000001 OpenFlow switch is always the smallest value and is selected as the root bridge.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_switch_stp_13.py

    :pyobject: SimpleSwitch13.__init__

STP Event Processing
""""""""""""""""""""

As with " :ref:`ch_link_aggregation` ", prepare the event handler to receive events notified by the STP library.



By using the ``stplib.EventPacketIn`` event defined in the STP library, it is possible to receive packets other than BPDU packets; therefore, the same packet handling is performed as " :ref:`ch_switching_hub` ".

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_switch_stp_13.py
    :dedent: 4
    :prepend: @set_ev_cls(stplib.EventPacketIn, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
    :pyobject: SimpleSwitch13._packet_in_handler
    :end-before:  pkt = packet.Packet(msg.data)
    :append: # ...

The change notification event (``stplib.EventTopologyChange``) of the network topology is received and the learned MAC address and registered flow entry are initialized.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_switch_stp_13.py
    :dedent: 4
    :pyobject: SimpleSwitch13.delete_flow

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_switch_stp_13.py
    :dedent: 4
    :prepend: @set_ev_cls(stplib.EventTopologyChange, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
    :pyobject: SimpleSwitch13._topology_change_handler

The change notification event (``stplib.EventPortStateChange``) of the port status is received and the debug log of the port status is output.

.. rst-class:: sourcecode

.. literalinclude:: ../../ryu/app/simple_switch_stp_13.py
    :dedent: 4
    :prepend: @set_ev_cls(stplib.EventPortStateChange, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
    :pyobject: SimpleSwitch13._port_state_change_handler

As explained above, by using the library that provides the spanning tree function and the application that uses the library, a switching hub application having a spanning tree function is achieved.



Conclusion
----------

This section uses the spanning tree library as material to explain the following items:

* Method of implementing event waiting processing using hub.Event
* Method of implementing timer control processing using hub.Timeout
